Course Project


# Dev Note: Re-import the file you exported before uploading. Automatic exports could fail, especially between different DB systems (local vs. Dept)

## File Structure
To add data, export `populate.sql` to your database and then insert your data there. Once done, export your database into a file of the same name (that is, `populate.sql`) and then commit it and push.

### Database Files:
- `dbStructure.sql` contains only the SQL for table creation. It should *NOT* contain any data.
- `populate.sql` is the our exported database. It has both table declaration and data.

### Files for Milestone 2 Requirement
- `sqlcmd.sql` is for storing all the SQL commands that will be used by our app.
